## 🧾 Project Description
This Power BI dashboard was developed for a U.S.-based company to analyze and optimize employee performance, satisfaction, and retention. It provides HR professionals and business leaders with actionable, data-driven insights through interactive and dynamic visualization tools.

The dashboard integrates performance metrics, satisfaction scores, attrition risks, and review timelines across multiple years. It includes drill-down functionality to view individual employee performance trajectories. For example, **Ada Bynold** is presented as a case study, and other employees can be selected via a dropdown for individualized analysis.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Traditional HR data is often siloed, outdated, or lacking in actionable insights. Without integrated and dynamic analytics, it’s difficult for HR teams to identify early warning signs of attrition, dissatisfaction, or performance issues. This dashboard solves that by centralizing key metrics into one accessible platform, allowing both macro-level organizational reviews and micro-level individual assessments.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Proactive HR Interventions**  
   Flag employees who show declining satisfaction or low balance trends for 1-on-1 check-ins. Use data as an early warning system to prevent disengagement.

2. **Enhance Work-Life Balance Programs**  
   Reduce burnout risk by reviewing workloads, offering flexible schedules, and promoting wellness initiatives—especially for roles showing high attrition rates (e.g., Sales, Recruitment).

3. **Strengthen Onboarding & Early Engagement**  
   Most attrition occurs within the first year. Tailored onboarding, mentorship, and goal-setting programs can help retain new hires longer.

4. **Enable Manager Calibration Training**  
   Regularly train managers on how to assess employee performance objectively and fairly, minimizing rating inconsistencies across departments.

5. **Develop Personalized Career Pathways**  
   Integrate development plans and role progression opportunities based on performance data. Employees like Ada Bynold, showing improved performance despite dissatisfaction, should be nurtured with new growth opportunities.

6. **Build Feedback Loops with Monthly Surveys**  
   Implement short, anonymous monthly feedback surveys to capture real-time insights into employee sentiment, leading to quicker responses.

7. **Predictive Attrition Modelling**  
   Use historical performance and satisfaction data to forecast attrition risks and take pre-emptive retention actions for vulnerable employees.

8. **Cross-Employee Performance Benchmarking**  
   Add the ability to compare employee performance across similar job roles, identifying top performers and support needs for others.

9. **Automated Alert System**  
   Configure alerts for overdue reviews, low performance dips, or continuous dissatisfaction, enabling HR to act in real-time.

## 📌 Case Study Highlight
**Ada Bynold's** 3-year performance and satisfaction journey is featured to demonstrate the dashboard’s depth. Ada showed declining satisfaction despite improved performance scores — a red flag that HR must act on. Other employees can be viewed similarly, making this a scalable solution across the workforce.
