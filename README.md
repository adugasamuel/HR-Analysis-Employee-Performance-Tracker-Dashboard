## üåê [üîó View Project in Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiM2RlNWQyMzktNTY1OC00ODEwLTgwM2EtYzc4ZjJkYTdmNzU5IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9&pageName=ReportSection)
## Introduction
This project involves the development of an interactive Employee Performance Tracker dashboard for a U.S.-based company. It is designed to assist HR managers in visualizing and monitoring the performance, satisfaction levels, and workplace engagement of individual employees over time. The goal is to transform traditionally static HR evaluations into dynamic, data-driven insights for improved talent management.

The third page of the dashboard specifically highlights Ada Bynold, serving as a case study to demonstrate how user-level insights are visualized. However, HR professionals can switch between different employees using the dropdown filter, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
## üßæ Project Description
This Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze and optimize employee performance, satisfaction, and retention. It provides HR professionals and business leaders with actionable, data-driven insights through interactive and dynamic visualization tools.

The dashboard integrates performance metrics, satisfaction scores, attrition risks, and review timelines across multiple years. It includes drill-down functionality to view individual employee performance trajectories. For example, **Ada Bynold** is presented as a case study, and other employees can be selected via a dropdown for individualized analysis.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement
Human Resources departments often struggle with fragmented, static, or outdated performance data. Without real-time, multi-year insights into employee satisfaction, manager evaluations, and key performance indicators (KPIs), it becomes difficult to detect early signs of attrition risk, disengagement, or productivity issues. This project solves that problem by delivering a centralized, interactive dashboard that enables performance tracking, satisfaction trend analysis, and timely decision-making.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

. **Proactive HR Interventions**  
   Flag employees who show declining satisfaction or low balance trends for 1-on-1 check-ins. Use data as an early warning system to prevent disengagement.

. **Enhance Work-Life Balance Programs**  
   Reduce burnout risk by reviewing workloads, offering flexible schedules, and promoting wellness initiatives‚Äîespecially for roles showing high attrition rates (e.g., Sales, Recruitment).

. **Strengthen Onboarding & Early Engagement**  
   Most attrition occurs within the first year. Tailored onboarding, mentorship, and goal-setting programs can help retain new hires longer.

. **Enable Manager Calibration Training**  
   Regularly train managers on how to assess employee performance objectively and fairly, minimizing rating inconsistencies across departments.

. **Develop Personalized Career Pathways**  
   Integrate development plans and role progression opportunities based on performance data. Employees like Ada Bynold, showing improved performance despite dissatisfaction, should be nurtured with new growth opportunities.

. **Build Feedback Loops with Monthly Surveys**  
   Implement short, anonymous monthly feedback surveys to capture real-time insights into employee sentiment, leading to quicker responses.

. **Predictive Attrition Modelling**  
   Use historical performance and satisfaction data to forecast attrition risks and take pre-emptive retention actions for vulnerable employees.

. **Cross-Employee Performance Benchmarking**  
   Add the ability to compare employee performance across similar job roles, identifying top performers and support needs for others.

. **Automated Alert System**  
   Configure alerts for overdue reviews, low performance dips, or continuous dissatisfaction, enabling HR to act in real-time.

## üìå Case Study Highlight
**Ada Bynold's** 3-year performance and satisfaction journey is featured to demonstrate the dashboard‚Äôs depth. Ada showed declining satisfaction despite improved performance scores ‚Äî a red flag that HR must act on. Other employees can be viewed similarly, making this a scalable solution across the workforce.
